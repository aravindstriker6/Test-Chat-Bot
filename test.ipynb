      "MS-970 coiled plastic pipe markers are designed to identify piping in a wide \n",

      "of the coiling process and therefore, do not rely on a pressure-sensitive \n",
      "adhesive. No preparation of the pipe surface is required for application, so \n",
      "installation time is reduced compared to conventional stick-on marker systems. \n",
      "Legends are sub-surface printed so they are protected by a layer of plastic. \n",

      "PART 3 EXECUTION 3.01 SUBMITTALS A. Division 22 shall provide submittal documentation relative to commissioning as required in this Section Part 1 and Section 019113. 3.02 STARTUP A. The plumbing and controls contractors shall follow the start-up and initial checkout procedures listed in the Responsibilities list in this section and in 019113. Division 22 has start-up responsibility and is required to complete systems and sub-systems so they are fully functional, meeting the design objectives of the Contract Documents. The commissioning procedures and functional testing do not relieve or lessen this responsibility or shift that responsibility partially to the CxA / GCCxR or Owner. B. Functional testing is intended to begin upon completion of a system. Functional testing may proceed prior to the completion of systems or sub-systems at the discretion of the CxA / GCCxR and A/E. Beginning system testing before full completion does not relieve the Contractor from fully completing the system, including all prefunctional checklists as soon as possible. 3.03 TAB A. Refer to the TAB responsibilities in Part 1.02 above. 3.04 FUNCTIONAL TESTS A. Refer to Section 019113 Part 1.06 for a list of systems to be commissioned and to Part 3.05 for a general description of the testing requirements. For selected plumbing equipment within the Cx scope, the supplying contractor will provide the CxA / GCCxR with a copy of the functional test or test plan for approval.\n"
